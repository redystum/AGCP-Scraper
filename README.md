Hi, AGCP is not a site I particularly enjoy visiting, but I believe this feature is important. Knowing which rooms are free at a given time allows students to study more freely, especially when study rooms are full. Apologies for any inconvenience caused (such as the number of requests made). If needed, you know how to contact me.
